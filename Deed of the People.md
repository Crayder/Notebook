# Deed of the People
_______
Stranded in this forest? What are you going to do about it? Build from the ground up in this server.


Adventure, evolution, life, hunting, crafting, building, and much more...? 

There are over 500 thousand (atm, there may be even more later) trees and rocks to chop down and mine. There are lakes and rain to collect water from.

There are many deer, fish, and cattle to hunt and herd. 

Scavenge meat, bones, and hides. Build many things from tools, weapons, assets, clothing, shelters, houses, to skyscrapers. 

Put together tribes, towns, and cities. Build your own empire. Defend a castle. Evolve into whatever you want. 

Of course there will also be picking, jobs, trading, and everything in-between.

_______

## _To-do_

- Finish the tree stand system.
- House system, that requires building houses in an open area clear of trees of course.
- Add a zipline system to make easy and quick transportation between tree stands and houses.
- Hell, if there are trees and houses why not make tree houses?
